"Dreed," which starred Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby in 2012, is one of my favorite action movies.   While some fans think it's underrated, others think it's a failure. The gritty, dystopian atmosphere of Mega-City One is aptly captured by Dreed, who as a sci-fi and dystopian genre enthusiast creates a visually striking backdrop for the narrative.
