## Never Had a Chance While They Were There:   **DREDD (2012)**

When this film came out, I was 22 years old. After a long day at work, I went to the theater and bought a ticket, little knowing that what I was about to witness was a stunning ballet of violence and clever storytelling.

**"DREDD"**, which starred *Karl Urban* and *Olivia Thirlby* in 2012, is one of my favorite action movies. While some fans think it's underrated, others think it's a failure. The gritty, dystopian atmosphere of Mega-City One is aptly captured by Dreed, who as a sci-fi and dystopian genre enthusiast creates a visually striking backdrop for the narrative.

The movie is set in a dystopian future in which a large portion of Earth has turned into a barren wasteland. The vast, violent metropolis known as **Mega-City One** is home to the majority of humanity. The majority of the action takes place inside Peach Trees, a sizable urban block under the control of Ma-Ma *(Lena Headey)*, a drug lord.

In essence, the movie follows Judge Dredd as he administers justice in a violent and chaotic world, day in and day out. For lovers of the character and the genre, the film offers a gritty and compelling experience because of its cramped setting and nonstop action.

The action scenes in this film are particularly well-known for being powerful and skillfully done.   The movie features strong visual effects that add to the immersive depiction of the futuristic world. The action scenes are choreographed and shot in a way that enhances the overall experience. The film embraces *violence*. For their striking visuals, the slow-motion drug scenes are especially noteworthy.

> If Hollywood is going to be indicted for making mindlessly violent action films, let them at least be as good as this one.

Fans of the "Judge Dredd" comic series have expressed appreciation for the film's fidelity to the source material, even though I haven't seen the first Sylvester Stallone film yet (1995). Fans could relate to the way it encapsulated the spirit of the character and the setting.

Though **"Dredd"** attracted a cult following and received positive reviews for these reasons **(80% RottenTomatoes, 75% Audience Score)**, it's important to remember that everyone has different tastes in movies and that not everyone will appreciate the same things. However, I still think this is an incredible film and that you should see it even ten years after it was released.
