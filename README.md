**"Dreed,"** which starred Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby in 2012, is one of my favorite action movies.   While some fans think it's underrated, others think it's a failure. The gritty, dystopian atmosphere of Mega-City One is aptly captured by Dreed, who as a sci-fi and dystopian genre enthusiast creates a visually striking backdrop for the narrative.

The action scenes in this film are particularly well-known for being powerful and skillfully done.   The movie features strong visual effects that add to the immersive depiction of the futuristic world. The action scenes are choreographed and shot in a way that enhances the overall experience. The film embraces violence. For their striking visuals, the slow-motion drug scenes are especially noteworthy.
